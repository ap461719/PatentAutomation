Here's the polished patent paragraph:

"A pharmaceutical composition comprises an anti-IL-12/IL-23p40 antibody having defined structural elements, wherein said antibody includes heavy and light chain variable regions with specific complementarity determining regions (CDRs). Within the heavy chain variable region reside three distinct CDR sequences: CDRH1, CDRH2, and CDRH3, each corresponding to predetermined amino acid sequences. The light chain variable region comprises CDRL1, CDRL2, and CDRL3 sequences, each defined by distinct amino acid sequences.

Characterization of the antibody structure is achieved through multiple sequence definitions, wherein one embodiment comprises a heavy chain variable region of a first defined amino acid sequence and a light chain variable region of a second defined amino acid sequence. In an alternative embodiment, the antibody is characterized by full-length heavy and light chain sequences, each comprising specific amino acid sequences encompassing both variable and constant regions.

The pharmaceutical composition is contained within packaging that incorporates drug product label elements, said elements including clinical data derived from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in pediatric subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis. Said packaging provides healthcare practitioners and patients with essential information regarding administration, dosing protocols, and demonstrated clinical outcomes based on the aforementioned trial data.

The clinical trial data, incorporated within said packaging elements, establishes therapeutic efficacy and safety parameters for treating pediatric patients diagnosed with moderate to severe psoriatic disease, wherein said data is derived from the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study methodology."

Here's the polished version with tightened legal language:

"The target population comprises pediatric subjects aged six years to under twelve years who are diagnosed with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis requiring advanced treatment modalities. Such subjects must demonstrate clinical characteristics warranting systemic intervention or phototherapy according to established medical criteria and disease severity assessments.

Determination of treatment candidacy is based on multiple clinical factors, including but not limited to: extent of cutaneous involvement, localization of plaques in sensitive or visible anatomical regions, quantifiable impact on quality of life metrics, and documented inadequate response to prior topical interventions. Whereas phototherapy candidates typically present with widespread plaque distribution suitable for light-based protocols, subjects qualifying for systemic therapy may exhibit severe disease manifestations or specific contraindications to phototherapeutic approaches.

Standardized scoring systems are employed for disease severity assessment, wherein parameters include affected body surface area, plaque characteristics (specifically erythema, induration, and scaling), and comprehensive disease impact metrics. Classification of moderate to severe disease generally corresponds to either greater than 10% body surface area involvement or substantial disease burden in critical anatomical locations. Further evaluation encompasses documented treatment history, presence of comorbid conditions, and age-appropriate assessment of systemic therapy tolerability.

The specified age range enables targeted demographic selection while incorporating developmental considerations pertinent to therapeutic administration in pediatric populations. Said age stratification facilitates implementation of appropriate dosing strategies and safety monitoring protocols specifically adapted for pediatric subjects presenting with severe disease manifestations requiring advanced therapeutic intervention."

Here's the polished patent version:

"Methods for subcutaneous delivery facilitate precise administration of therapeutic antibody formulations into the hypodermis, a connective tissue layer positioned between dermis and muscle tissue. Such administration employs specialized injection devices and techniques that are optimized for pediatric patients based on age-specific anatomical considerations and tissue depth parameters.

The anterior thigh, upper outer arm, and lower abdomen serve as primary injection sites, wherein site selection depends upon subcutaneous tissue adequacy and accessibility. Implementation of the administration technique requires positioning the needle at an angle of 45 to 90 degrees relative to the skin surface, thereby ensuring proper subcutaneous space placement while preventing intramuscular penetration. Sequential rotation among injection sites serves to maintain consistent drug absorption patterns and minimize tissue alterations.

The antibody formulation comprises engineered physical properties, including specified viscosity, osmolality, and pH parameters, that facilitate optimal subcutaneous dispersal and absorption. Said properties enable efficient distribution through the extracellular matrix post-administration while preserving protein stability and bioavailability. Furthermore, the formulation's physiochemical characteristics address specific features of pediatric subcutaneous tissue, including distinct adipose distribution and vascularization patterns relative to adult tissue.

Dose volumes are determined according to pediatric-specific parameters, whereby individual administration volumes are optimized to achieve therapeutic efficacy while minimizing injection site reactions. The subcutaneous route of administration provides distinct advantages, including reduced invasiveness, enhanced convenience, and suitability for supervised home administration, particularly beneficial for long-term pediatric therapeutic protocols."

Here's the polished patent paragraph with formal USPTO language:

"Methods of treatment are provided comprising weight-based dosing regimens for subcutaneous administration of anti-IL-12/IL-23p40 antibodies to pediatric subjects afflicted with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. The dosing regimens comprise three distinct weight-based tiers for precise dose administration.

In one embodiment, subjects weighing below 60 kilograms receive a weight-normalized dose of 0.5 to 1.0 milligrams per kilogram body weight, wherein 0.75 milligrams per kilogram represents the optimal therapeutic dose. For subjects weighing between 60 and 100 kilograms, fixed doses of 35 to 55 milligrams are administered, wherein 45 milligrams comprises the preferred dose. Subjects exceeding 100 kilograms in body weight receive doses ranging from 80 to 100 milligrams, wherein 90 milligrams constitutes the preferred therapeutic dose.

The anti-IL-12/IL-23p40 antibody comprises defined complementarity determining regions (CDRs), specifically three heavy chain CDRs and three light chain CDRs characterized by specified amino acid sequences. Certain embodiments incorporate complete variable regions or full-length heavy and light chains having predetermined amino acid sequences.

Pharmacokinetic assessments confirm achievement of therapeutic drug concentrations within safety parameters suitable for pediatric populations. Drug exposure correlates with clinical response parameters, including psoriatic plaque reduction, decreased affected body surface area, and quality of life improvements. Serum concentration monitoring facilitates dose optimization based on individual response characteristics.

The dosing regimens comprise initial loading doses followed by maintenance doses administered at intervals determined through clinical response assessment and safety monitoring. Therapeutic drug monitoring enables interval adjustment based on individual pharmacokinetic parameters."
