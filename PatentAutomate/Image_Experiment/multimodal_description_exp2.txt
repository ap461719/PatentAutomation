The apparatus depicted in FIG. 1 illustrates a main assembly 100 configured for use in an injection molding system. The main assembly 100 incorporates a channel 102, which extends from a channel proximal end to a channel distal end, facilitating the flow of molten plastic. The channel 102 is fluidly connected to an inlet 103 at its proximal end. The inlet 103 is designed with a first inlet surface at its distal end, which interfaces with the channel 102 to ensure seamless flow of material. The inlet 103 is further coupled to a nozzle 106 at its proximal end, which serves as the entry point for injecting molten plastic into the channel 102.

The valve assembly 200 is translatably coupled to the channel 102, allowing for movement between an open and a closed position. The valve assembly 200 comprises a valve proximal end and a valve distal end, with a first valve surface located at the valve proximal end. This configuration enables the formation of a diameter seal between the first inlet surface of the inlet 103 and the first valve surface of the valve assembly 200 when in the closed position, effectively preventing the flow of molten plastic.

The valve assembly 200 may include additional features such as at least one fin and at least one groove extending from the valve proximal end to the valve distal end, facilitating the controlled movement and alignment of the valve within the channel 102. Furthermore, the valve assembly 200 may be equipped with a tail at the valve proximal end, which extends towards the inlet proximal end. This tail may include a plurality of markers to indicate the position of the valve from the open position to the closed position, enhancing operational precision.

In certain embodiments, the tail may feature an enlarged tail portion with a tail surface that creates a tail seal with the first inlet surface of the inlet 103. Additionally, the valve assembly 200 may incorporate a hollow recess within the valve proximal end, featuring a hollow recess threaded surface that engages with a tail threaded surface at the distal tail end, allowing for secure attachment of the tail to the valve.

The system may also include an adapter with an inner adapter threaded surface, and a plurality of spacers, each with proximal and distal threaded surfaces. These components can be threadingly engaged to adjust the length between the first valve surface of the valve assembly 200 and the first inlet surface of the inlet 103 when the valve is in the closed position, providing flexibility in operation and ensuring optimal sealing performance.
