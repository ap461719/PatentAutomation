The depicted injection molding system, labeled as element 100, comprises several integral components including an injector 102, a nozzle 103, a manifold 106, and a valve assembly 200. The injector 102 is configured to direct molten plastic through the nozzle 103, which is coupled to the manifold 106. The manifold 106 serves as a conduit for the molten plastic, directing it towards the valve assembly 200.

The valve assembly 200 is a critical component, designed to regulate the flow of molten plastic within the system. It includes a channel with a proximal end and a distal end, facilitating the movement of the molten material. The inlet of the valve assembly, which interfaces with the nozzle 103 at its proximal end, features a first inlet surface at its distal end. This inlet is fluidly coupled to the channel at the channel's proximal end, enabling the injection of molten plastic into the channel.

The valve within the assembly is translatably coupled to the channel, allowing it to move between open and closed positions. This valve comprises a proximal end, a distal end, and a first valve surface located at the proximal end. When the valve is in the closed position, a diameter seal is formed between the first inlet surface of the inlet and the first valve surface, effectively preventing the flow of molten plastic.

Additionally, the valve assembly may include an inlet diameter surface and a valve diameter surface, which together create a diameter seal when the valve is closed. In some configurations, the inlet and valve may also feature tapered surfaces that form a taper seal, enhancing the sealing capability when the valve is in the closed position.

The valve may further incorporate structural features such as at least one fin and groove extending from the proximal to the distal end, facilitating the movement and alignment of the valve within the channel. A tail may be present at the proximal end of the valve, extending towards the inlet proximal end, possibly marked to indicate the valve's position. This tail may include an enlarged portion with a tail surface, which forms a tail seal with the first inlet surface when the valve is closed.

In certain embodiments, the valve assembly may include a hollow recess with a threaded surface, allowing for the threaded engagement of a tail, enhancing the modularity and adjustability of the system. An adapter and plurality of spacers may be employed to adjust the length between the valve and inlet surfaces, further refining the control over the injection process.

The described configuration ensures precise control over the flow of molten plastic, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of the injection molding process.
