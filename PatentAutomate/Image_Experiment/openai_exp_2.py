Your response must:
- Output a numbered list of the labeled components from the figure (e.g., 102, 104, etc.).
- For each label, include a short description (just a few words or one sentence).
- Only include information visible or implied from the image and claims.
- Write in clean, plain English.
- Do NOT generate full paragraphs or patent-style prose.
- Do NOT mention or describe the claims explicitly.
- Do NOT include any markdown or formatting (no bold, italics, or code). Just plain text.

Strictly avoid:
- Advocating or subjective language such as "critical", "important", "necessary", "the invention", "must", etc.
- Any language that limits claim scope or implies essentiality
- Markdown formatting or bullets

- Use the component list to guide your terminology and naming.
- Do not copy claim language. Instead, explain how components work or interact.
