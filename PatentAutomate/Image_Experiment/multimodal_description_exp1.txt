The depicted valve assembly, designated as element 100, is part of an injection molding system. It comprises a channel 106 with a channel proximal end and a channel distal end. The assembly includes an inlet 102, which features a first inlet surface at its distal end. This inlet is fluidly coupled to the channel at the channel proximal end and connects to a nozzle at the inlet proximal end for the purpose of injecting molten plastic into the channel.

A valve 200 is translatably coupled to the channel 106, capable of moving between an open and a closed position. The valve includes a valve proximal end and a valve distal end, with a first valve surface located at the valve proximal end. When the valve is in the closed position, a diameter seal is formed between the first inlet surface of the inlet 102 and the first valve surface of the valve 200.

The inlet 102 further comprises an inlet diameter surface at its distal end, while the valve 200 includes a valve diameter surface at its proximal end. These surfaces interact to create the diameter seal when the valve is closed. Additionally, the inlet 102 and valve 200 each feature a tapered surface at their respective distal and proximal ends, forming a taper seal in the closed position.

The valve 200 is equipped with at least one fin and at least one groove extending from the valve proximal end to the valve distal end, facilitating the movement of molten plastic. Furthermore, the valve includes a tail extending from the valve proximal end towards the inlet proximal end. This tail may be marked with a plurality of markers indicating the valve's position from open to closed. The tail also includes an enlarged tail portion with a tail surface that creates a tail seal with the first inlet surface of the inlet.

A hollow recess within the valve proximal end features a threaded surface, which engages with a tail threaded surface at the distal tail end, allowing for the connection of the tail to the valve. An adapter with an inner adapter threaded surface and a plurality of spacers, each with proximal and distal threaded surfaces, are provided. These components engage to adjust the length between the first valve surface and the first inlet surface when the valve is closed.

The first inlet surface and the first valve surface are circular in cross-section, and the valve is identified as a torpedo valve. The injection molding system includes a manifold with a channel, a plastic injector with a nozzle, and the described valve assembly, ensuring precise control of molten plastic flow through the channel.
