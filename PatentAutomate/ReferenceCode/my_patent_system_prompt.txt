The isolated antibody or antigen-binding fragment incorporates a variant Fc region derived from the IgG4 subclass. This specific choice of Fc region is strategically made to leverage the unique properties of IgG4, which are particularly advantageous in therapeutic applications.

The IgG4 Fc region is characterized by its reduced ability to engage with Fcγ receptors compared to other IgG subclasses. This property minimizes the activation of immune effector functions such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). In therapeutic contexts, this can be beneficial for reducing potential inflammatory responses and minimizing tissue damage, especially in chronic treatment scenarios where prolonged antibody presence is required.

Additionally, the IgG4 Fc region is known for its ability to undergo Fab-arm exchange, a process where half-molecules can swap with those of another IgG4 molecule. This feature can contribute to a more dynamic and adaptable antibody response, potentially enhancing the antibody's ability to neutralize diverse viral strains by increasing the diversity of antigen-binding sites.

The functional significance of incorporating an IgG4 Fc region lies in its ability to provide a balanced therapeutic profile. By reducing effector function engagement, the antibody can offer a more controlled and less inflammatory response, which is particularly important in treating conditions where immune-mediated damage is a concern. This makes the IgG4-based antibody suitable for long-term administration, as it reduces the risk of adverse immune reactions.

Moreover, the IgG4 Fc region's properties can enhance the antibody's pharmacokinetic profile, contributing to a longer serum half-life and sustained therapeutic levels. This reduces the frequency of dosing required, improving patient compliance and convenience.

In summary, the incorporation of an IgG4 Fc region in the antibody or antigen-binding fragment provides a strategic advantage by balancing reduced immune activation with enhanced pharmacokinetics.
