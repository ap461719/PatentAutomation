1. One or more non-transitory computer readable medium (NTCRM) comprising instructions, wherein execution of the instructions by controller circuitry of a material recovery facility (MRF) is to cause the controller circuitry to:
receive data streams from respective MRF components of a plurality of MRF components deployed at various locations in the MRF, wherein the plurality of MRF components includes a set of sensors and a set of material handling units (MHUs);
process the data streams to determine an MRF status of the MRF, wherein the MRF status is based on a composition of a material stream at one or more locations within the MRF and an operating condition of at least one MRF component of the plurality of MRF components, and wherein the composition of the material stream is based on identification and classification of objects within the material streams;
determine an MRF arrangement of the plurality of MRF components based on the MRF status, wherein the MRF arrangement of the plurality of MRF components optimizes recovery and/or purity of at least one targetable material from the material stream; and
retask an individual MHU of the set of MHUs, and to retask the individual MHU, execution of the instructions is to cause the control circuitry to: cause the individual MHU to move from a current location within the MRF to a different location within the MRF.
18. A compute node of a material recovery facility (MRF), comprising:
interface circuitry to receive data streams from respective MRF components of a plurality of MRF components deployed at various locations in the MRF; and
processor circuitry connected to the interface circuitry, wherein the processor circuitry is to:
process the data streams to determine an MRF status of the MRF, wherein the MRF status is based on a composition of a material stream at one or more locations within the MRF and an operating condition of at least one MRF component of the plurality of MRF components, and wherein the composition of the material stream is based on identification and classification of objects within the material streams;
determine an MRF arrangement of the plurality of MRF components based on the MRF status, wherein the MRF arrangement of the plurality of MRF components optimizes recovery and/or purity of at least one targetable material from the material stream; and
retask the at least one MRF component including: cause the at least one MRF component to move from a current location within the MRF to a service center when the operating condition of the at least one MRF component indicates that service is needed.
